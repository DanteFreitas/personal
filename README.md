 This is a summary of some of the projects I developed.
 
 ## BLDC Motor Controller

Like the previous project, this BLDC Motor controller schematic and PCB layout were designed by me. The goal of the project was to develop a motor controller for the science outreach team Eco Octano from Universidade Federal do Paraná (UFPR). The team participates in Shell Eco-marathon, a worldwide competition for the most energy efficient vehicles.
 
 ## DC Motor Controller
